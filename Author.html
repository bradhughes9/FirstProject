						<h1>About me</h1>
						<p>
							My name is Bradley Hughes and I am a full time student at Lorain County Community College, I also work full time for Digital Room Inc. I've just started taking classes
							at the college teaching me how to write HTML, CSS, and a little bit of Java Script. I decided to make this website about Cleveland so that people can know more about the city
							whether you're from the Cleveland area or just plan to visit. I hope the information from each page has made you more eager to learn more and actually want to visit some of these
							places. There is so much to do in and around Cleveland that people with all different interests can find plenty of things to do. I only covered a fraction of things to do and places to
							see in this beautiful city.
